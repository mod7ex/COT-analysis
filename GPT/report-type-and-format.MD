## The short, honest answer

**Use ONE primary report, ONE trader group, and ONE net format.**

> Financial Futures (if you trade FX, indices, rates)

> Disaggregated (if you trade commodities)

> Net positioning (Long − Short), not longs or shorts alone

---

Now let’s break *why*.

## 1️⃣ Which report should YOU focus on?

### 🔹 If you trade FX, indices, bonds, rates

**→ Financial Futures report (NON-Commercials)**

Why?

* Designed specifically for **speculative vs hedging flows**
* Clean separation between:

  * **Dealers** (hedging)
  * **Asset Managers** (real money)
  * **Leveraged Funds** (speculation)

👉 **Leveraged Funds = “smart speculative money”**

This is the best report for:

* EUR, JPY, GBP, AUD
* S&P 500, Nasdaq
* Treasuries

---

### 🔹 If you trade commodities (oil, gold, ags, grains)

**→ Disaggregated report**

Why?

* Producers, merchants, processors actually **matter** in commodities
* Legacy report hides too much detail

👉 In commodities:

* **Producers/Merchants** = commercial hedgers
* **Managed Money** = speculators you want to track

---

### 🚫 When to use the Legacy report

Use **Legacy** only if:

* You need **very long historical data**
* You’re doing macro research, not trading signals

Otherwise?
👉 **Skip it** — it’s too blunt for modern markets.

## 2️⃣ Which trader category should you follow?

### 🧠 Rule of thumb for retail traders

| Market               | Trader group to watch                | Why                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| FX / Indices / Rates | **Leveraged Funds (Non-Commercial)** | Momentum & trend drivers     |
| Commodities          | **Managed Money**                    | Crowd positioning & extremes |
| Macro context        | Asset Managers                       | Slow, structural flows       |

💡 Dealers are *important* but hard to trade off — they’re usually hedging, not speculating.

---

## 3️⃣ Long, short… or net?

### ✅ Always focus on **NET positions**

```
Net = Longs − Shorts
```

Why?

* Raw longs or shorts **lie by omission**
* Funds can be massively long *and* massively short at the same time

👉 Net tells you **directional conviction**

---

### How to actually read it

You want to know:

* Is net positioning **extreme**?
* Is it **increasing or decreasing**?
* Is price **confirming or diverging**?

Examples:

* 🚨 Extreme net longs + price stalls → reversal risk
* 📈 Net longs rising + breakout → trend confirmation
* ⚠️ Net shorts decreasing → short covering rally

---

## 4️⃣ Best format for retail traders

If you remember only one thing, remember this:

> **Weekly change in NET positioning**
> (Δ Net = this week − last week)

This is where **timing** comes from.

---

## 5️⃣ My recommended setup (simple & powerful)

### For FX / indices:

* **Report:** Financial Futures
* **Group:** Leveraged Funds
* **Metric:** Net positions + weekly change
* **Use case:** Trend confirmation & exhaustion

### For commodities:

* **Report:** Disaggregated
* **Group:** Managed Money
* **Metric:** Net % of Open Interest
* **Use case:** Sentiment extremes & reversals

---

## 6️⃣ One important warning

COT is:

* ❌ NOT a timing tool by itself
* ✅ A **context and bias tool**

Use it with:

* Structure
* Trend
* Key levels
* Macro narrative

---

### Final takeaway

> **As a retail trader:
> ignore complexity, track the speculators, use NET positioning, and look for extremes + changes.**

If you want, tell me **what you trade** (FX pair, index, commodity), and I’ll show you **exactly which COT line to watch and how to interpret the last few weeks**.


* Trading **commodities** → watch **Managed Money**
* Trading **FX, indices, rates** → watch **Leveraged Funds**
